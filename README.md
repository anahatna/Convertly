# Convertly
Python Image Recognition Currency Conversion App (Open Exchange API)

During my university exchange in England, one common issue I faced was converting the British pound to Canadian dollars. The constant mental math and google searches became tedious 
and inconvenient. Hence, the idea to create Convertly came to life. 

Convertly is a seamless currency conversion app designed to streamline your travel experiences. It give you access to over 200 currencies, with currency rates updated
daily, through the Open Exchange API, allowing you to take a picture of a price tag or manually input the amount of currency you want to convert.
